Homework Xerox Range Pricing and Price Optimization
Due date: Nov 8, team assignment.
The objective of this assignment is to learn how to implement and populate complex commerce
and trade models. In this exercise, implement the Xerox sales process object model by mapping
it to java classes and then populate the model with products, customer, orders, and sales
personnel. In addition, you are required to read data from a file that have product, customer,
and order data. Once the data is loaded to the model, you are required to aggregate the data
and output to a report in the form of a dashboard. Your report must answer the following
questions and all in relation revenue totals:
1) Our top 3 best negotiated products (meaning products that sell above target)
2) Our 3 best customers (customers who buy about target price)
3) Our top 3 best sales people (sell higher that target)
4) Our total revenue for the year that is above expected target
5) Determine if the company is pricing its products correctly. Show how to make changes
so prices are performing at optimum levels. [As we discussed in class]
There is no need for a UI for this assignment. Printing the results on the command line will be
sufficient.
During the code review, you will be given a file that you will be required to load into your
application and produce the results. The TAs will supply you with test data to make sure you are
reading the data in in the correct format.
